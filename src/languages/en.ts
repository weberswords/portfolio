    title: "My Teaching Philosophy",
    text: ["My teaching philosophy is grounded in pragmatism and constructionism, striving to blend practicality with active learning. In an ideal world, I adhere to constructionism's ethos of creating meaningful artifacts. However, above all else, I am a pragmatist, prioritizing the application of knowledge in real-world contexts. In my ideal classroom, students are not passive recipients of information but active builders of knowledge and skills that they can directly apply. This approach not only enhances their understanding but also fosters a sense of ownership and relevance.", "Relevance is central to my student-centered approach. I firmly believe that for learning to be effective and meaningful, it must connect directly to students' lives and aspirations. This is especially critical in today's fast-paced professional world, where practicality and efficiency are paramount.", "As educators, we have a responsibility to critically examine the context in which we teach. An anti-racist approach not only challenges biases but also empowers learners by promoting collective knowledge-building and fostering equality between educator and student. By embracing anti-racist strategies, we create inclusive learning environments where all students can see themselves reflected and valued, thereby enriching the educational journey for everyone involved."]
